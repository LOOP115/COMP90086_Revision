# 2 - Image filtering



## Spatial filtering

##### Pixel operator: Computes an output value at each pixel location, based on the input pixel value

* Transform pixel based on its value

* Gamma correction

##### Local operator: Computes an output value at each pixel location, based on a neighbourhood of pixels around the input pixel

* Transform pixel based on its neighbours

* e.g. sharpening filter

##### Linear filtering: Output pixel’s value is a weighted sum of a neighbourhood around the input pixel



#### Cross-correlation vs. Convolution

* Cross-correlation: overlay filter on image
* Convolution: flip filter horizontally and vertically
* They are operations that apply a linear filter to an image.

* Illustration: L2.1 P13-18



#### Common filters

* Average/blur filters: average pixel values, blur the image
* Sharpening filters: subtract pixel from surround, increase fine detail
* Edge filters: compute difference between pixels, detect oriented edges in image

![2-5](C:\Users\cjhm0\Desktop\COMP90086_Revision\Modules\images\2\2-5.jpg) No change. Behave like a pixel operator

![2-6](C:\Users\cjhm0\Desktop\COMP90086_Revision\Modules\images\2\2-6.jpg) Shift left by 1 pixel

![2-7](C:\Users\cjhm0\Desktop\COMP90086_Revision\Modules\images\2\2-7.jpg) Sharpening filter. Accentuates differences with local average.

##### Gaussian

##### Sobel: L2.1 P26, 27

* Detect edges (Vertical, Horizontal)
* More weight on center which provides a bit smoothing.

##### Colour image filtering: Multiple channels

* Convolve each layer: 2D convolution in each colour channel -> Output is 3 channels
* 3D kernel: Output is 1 channel

##### Filter design examples

* Diagonal edges: e.g. [[0, 1, 2], [-1, 0, 1], [-2, -1, 0]]
* Simulate (linear) motion blur: e.g. 1D gaussian layer



#### Filters in practice

##### Properties of linear filters

#### <img src="C:\Users\cjhm0\Desktop\COMP90086_Revision\Modules\images\2\2-9.jpg" alt="2-9" style="zoom: 67%;" />

##### Efficient filtering

* Multiple filters: generally more efficient to combine 2D filters ( ℎ1∗ℎ2∗ℎ3…) and filter image just once L2.1 P35
* Separable filters: generally more efficient to filter with two 1D filters than one 2D filter    L2.1 P37
* For example, the 2D Gaussian can be expressed as a product of two 1D Gaussians (in x and y)![2-10](C:\Users\cjhm0\Desktop\COMP90086_Revision\Modules\images\2\2-10.jpg)

##### Convolution output size

Valid convolution: The output image is smaller than the input image

##### Border handling	L2.1 P39-42

* Pad with constant value
* Wrap image
* Clamp/replicate the border value
* Reflect image

##### Practical considerations

* Think about how to implement filters efficiently
  * Images are big, so efficient filtering can save a lot of time.
* Think about how to handle borders
  * No one-size-fits-all solution
  * Wrap is ideal for tilling textures (but not photos)
  * Clamp/replicate tends to work will for photos

* Linear filters: first step of almost all computer vision systems
* Linear filters are just a first step: you can’t build complex feature detectors from just linear filters.



## Frequency filtering

### Fourier analysis (1D)

##### Any signals or pattern can be described as a sum of *sinusoids* (L2.2 P7-13).

Sum of sinusoids: (L2.2 P14-17)<img src="C:\Users\cjhm0\Desktop\COMP90086_Revision\Modules\images\2\2-11.jpg" alt="2-11" style="zoom:67%;" />

#### Fourier transform

#### <img src="C:\Users\cjhm0\Desktop\COMP90086_Revision\Modules\images\2\2-12.jpg" alt="2-12" style="zoom:80%;" />

##### Frequency Spectrum	L2.2 P19-21

* Values in frequency domain are complex numbers
* For each frequency : magnitude (= amplitude) and angle (= phase)



### Fourier analysis (images)	L2.2 P24-34

* Any image can be represented by its Fourier transform
* Fourier transform = for each frequency, magnitude (amplitude) + phase

<img src="C:\Users\cjhm0\Desktop\COMP90086_Revision\Modules\images\2\2-13.jpg" alt="2-13" style="zoom:67%;" />      <img src="C:\Users\cjhm0\Desktop\COMP90086_Revision\Modules\images\2\2-14.jpg" alt="2-14" style="zoom:67%;" />

##### Magnitude and phase

* Magnitude is easy to read, giving the characteristics of the texture of the image.
* Phase represents actual structures and edges.
* Magnitude captures the holistic “texture” of an image, but the edges are mainly represented by Fourier phase



### Frequency filtering

#### <img src="C:\Users\cjhm0\Desktop\COMP90086_Revision\Modules\images\2\2-15.jpg" alt="2-15" style="zoom:80%;" />

#### Band pass filter: A filter that removes a range of frequencies from a signal

* ##### Low pass filter

  * Keep low spatial frequencies, remove high frequencies	L2.2 P38-40
  * Equivalent to blurring the image

* ##### High pass filter

  * Keep high spatial frequencies, remove low frequencies	L2.2 P41-43

* "Ringing problem": Proof by inverse convolution theorem
  * Use Gaussian low/high pass filter

#### Summary

* Images can be filtered in the spatial domain, or the frequency domain
* Operations in one domain have an equivalent in the other domain
  * Convolution in spatial domain = multiplication in Fourier domain
* Modelling filters in both domains can help understand/debug what a filter is doing



### Applications

#### Image compression

* Frequency domain is a convenient space for image compression
* Human visual system is not very sensitive to contrast in high spatial frequencies
* Discarding information in high spatial frequencies doesn’t change the “look” of an image
* JPEG compression: break image into 8x8 pixel blocks, each represented in frequency space
* Discrete cosine transform (DCT)
* High spatial frequency components are quantised

#### Image forensic (鉴定)	L2.2 P54-56

#### Summary

* Any image can be represented in either the spatial or the frequency domain
* Frequency domain is a convenient space for many applications:
  * Filtering
  * Compression
  * Forensics
  * Frequency-based features
