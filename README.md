# COMP90054 - Final Revision



## Exam Format

* Canvas quiz exam
* The exam will follow the same format as the practice exam available on the LMS.
* The number of questions will be similar but may not be exactly the same as the practice exam.
  * It can vary a little depending on how we split up subparts of questions.

* We would prefer students type their answers in the quiz and not upload images, but you can upload images if you really wish.
  * Bearing in mind that if we cannot open/view your images for any reason we will not be able to mark them.
